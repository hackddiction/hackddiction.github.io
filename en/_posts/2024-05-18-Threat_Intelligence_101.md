## What is Threat Intelligence?

Threat Intelligence, Threat Intel or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) refers to the process of **gathering, analyzing, and acting upon relevant information about potential threats and risks to an organizationâ€™s security**. This information can include indicators of compromise (IOCs); tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber attacks; as well as profiles of malicious actors. The main objective of Threat Intelligence is to **enable organizations to proactively anticipate, mitigate, and respond to cyber threats**, thereby strengthening their defenses and reducing the risk of negative impacts on their assets, data, and operations.

## Types of Threat Intelligence

According to IBM, there are three main types of threat intelligence. You can find the complete [IBM Threat Intelligence article here!](https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-intelligence#Types+of+threat+intelligence)

### Tactical Threat Intelligence
**Tactical Threat Intelligence** focuses on the **immediate detection and response to cyber threats**. It involves specific indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as malicious IP addresses, file hashes, and phishing email subject lines. This type of intelligence aids security operations centers (SOCs) and incident response teams in filtering out false positives and identifying real threats.

**Tactical Threat Intelligence** played a crucial role in the case of **SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack back in 2020**. Security researchers analyzed network traffic, malware samples, and command-and-control infrastructure to uncover the extent of the compromise and develop remediation strategies.

### Operational Threat Intelligence
**Operational Threat Intelligence** provides detailed insights into specific cyber attacks. It includes information on the **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by threat actors. This type of intelligence supports **proactive defense measures**, helping organizations understand the nature of the threats they face and how to defend against them effectively. It is particularly useful for security operations centers and incident response teams in **planning and executing defensive actions**.

**Emotet case** can be use as an example of **practical Operational Threat Intelligence**. Emotet is a sophisticated malware strain known for its ability to deliver other malware payloads, such as TrickBot and Ryuk ransomware. Operational Threat Intelligence has been crucial in **monitoring Emotet's infrastructure, tracking distribution campaigns, and identifying newly compromised systems**. Security teams **leverage this intelligenc**e to block malicious email attachments, detect Emotet infections, and disrupt command-and-control communications to **prevent further malware propagation**.

### Strategic Threat Intelligence
**Strategic Threat Intelligence** involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of information to understand **long-term trends, patterns, and potential risks** that could impact an organization's overall security posture. It focuses on providing **high-level insights** and guidance to inform strategic decision-making, such as resource allocation, policy development, and risk mitigation strategies. Strategic threat intelligence aims to anticipate emerging threats, identify vulnerabilities, and assess the broader landscape of cyber threats and risks to help organizations **stay ahead of potential security challenges**.

Organizations often rely on **Strategic Threat Intelligence provided by industry reports, studies, and assessments** to understand broader trends and emerging threats relevant to their sector. For instance, the annual reports from security vendors offer strategic insights into prevalent threats, attack vectors, and industry-specific vulnerabilities. Companies use this intelligence to **support their security strategies, prioritize investments, and allocate resources effectively**.
